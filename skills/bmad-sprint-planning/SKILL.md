# Sprint Planning Workflow

**Goal:** Generate sprint status tracking from epics, detecting current story statuses and building a complete sprint-status.yaml file.

**Your Role:** You are a Developer generating and maintaining sprint tracking. Parse epic files, detect story statuses, and produce a structured sprint-status.yaml.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `checklist.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Run the Orientation Digest

Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/orient.py --project-root {project-root}` — one read-only call, before anything else. It carries both roots, the core config this run reads (`{user_name}`, `{communication_language}`, `{document_output_language}`, `{project_name}`, `{date}` as `today`), every resolved output path (incl. `{planning_artifacts}`), the record inventory, the board's live focus (with a `STALE` flag when a hot run still claims `complete`) and **waiting hand-offs addressed to you** (the digest names the sender and the peek command), and skeleton/gate state. Read it once; never re-run it "for clean output" — it is small by construction. On failure, fall through to the config step's neutral defaults.

### Step 2: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow` — use your harness-native shell tool with the command as given (no extra wrapper params)

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 3: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 4: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs (`{metodoloji-root}/…` resolves against the plugin root; other paths under `{project-root}`) — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 5: Load Config

**Config comes from the digest** (Step 1). Only a key it genuinely lacks needs a targeted read: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --key <dotted.path>` — the targeted shape survives the transport; **never the full merged dump**. Resolve:

- `project_name`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`
- `implementation_artifacts`
- `planning_artifacts`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`
- Generate all documents in `{document_output_language}`

### Step 6: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 7: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

### Step 8: Chain Handshake

Check for signals addressed to you before the workflow begins: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py handoffs --skill bmad-sprint-planning --project-root {project-root}` — the canonical sender is an `Implementation Readiness` run (`bmad-check-implementation-readiness`) whose note names the readiness report and verdict to honor. Read the named report first, then complete the handshake: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py consume --channel handoff.bmad-sprint-planning --project-root {project-root}` (consume only after the named report is located — an unconsumed signal keeps the hand-off waiting, which is correct when the user routes elsewhere).

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

## Paths

- `tracking_system` = `file-system`
- `project_key` = `NOKEY`
- `story_location` = `{implementation_artifacts}`
- `story_location_absolute` = `{implementation_artifacts}`
- `epics_location` = `{planning_artifacts}`
- `epics_pattern` = `*epic*.md`
- `status_file` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`

## Input Files

| Input | Path | Load Strategy |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Epics | `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*.md` (whole) or `{planning_artifacts}/*epic*/*.md` (sharded) | FULL_LOAD |

## Execution

### Document Discovery - Full Epic Loading

**Strategy**: Sprint planning needs ALL epics and stories to build complete status tracking.

**Epic Discovery Process:**

1. **Search for whole document first** - Look for `epics.md`, `bmm-epics.md`, or any `*epic*.md` file
2. **Check for sharded version** - If whole document not found, look for `epics/index.md`
3. **If sharded version found**:
   - Read `index.md` to understand the document structure
   - Read ALL epic section files listed in the index (e.g., `epic-1.md`, `epic-2.md`, etc.)
   - Process all epics and their stories from the combined content
   - This ensures complete sprint status coverage
4. **Priority**: If both whole and sharded versions exist, use the whole document

**Fuzzy matching**: Be flexible with document names - users may use variations like `epics.md`, `bmm-epics.md`, `user-stories.md`, etc.

<step n="1" goal="Parse epic files and extract all work items">
<action>Load {project_context} for project-wide patterns and conventions (if exists)</action>
<action>Communicate in {communication_language} with {user_name}</action>
<action>Look for all files matching `{epics_pattern}` in {epics_location}</action>
<action>Could be a single `epics.md` file or multiple `epic-1.md`, `epic-2.md` files</action>

<action>For each epic file found, extract:</action>

- Epic numbers from headers like `## Epic 1:` or `## Epic 2:`
- Story IDs and titles from patterns like `### Story 1.1: User Authentication`
- Convert story format from `Epic.Story: Title` to kebab-case key: `epic-story-title`

**Story ID Conversion Rules:**

- Original: `### Story 1.1: User Authentication`
- Replace period with dash: `1-1`
- Convert title to kebab-case: `user-authentication`
- Final key: `1-1-user-authentication`

<action>Build complete inventory of all epics and stories from all epic files</action>
</step>

<step n="2" goal="Build sprint status structure">
<action>For each epic found, create entries in this order:</action>

1. **Epic entry** - Key: `epic-{num}`, Default status: `backlog`
2. **Story entries** - Key: `{epic}-{story}-{title}`, Default status: `backlog`
3. **Retrospective entry** - Key: `epic-{num}-retrospective`, Default status: `optional`

**Example structure:**

```yaml
development_status:
  epic-1: backlog
  1-1-user-authentication: backlog
  1-2-account-management: backlog
  epic-1-retrospective: optional
```

</step>

<step n="3" goal="Apply intelligent status detection">
<action>For each story, detect current status by checking files:</action>

**Story file detection:**

- Check: `{story_location_absolute}/{story-key}.md` (e.g., `stories/1-1-user-authentication.md`)
- If exists → upgrade status to at least `ready-for-dev`

**Preservation rule:**

- If existing `{status_file}` exists and has more advanced status, preserve it
- Never downgrade status (e.g., don't change `done` to `ready-for-dev`)
- If existing `{status_file}` has an `action_items` section, carry it over unchanged

**Status Flow Reference:**

- Epic: `backlog` → `in-progress` → `done`
- Story: `backlog` → `ready-for-dev` → `in-progress` → `review` → `done`
- Retrospective: `optional` ↔ `done`
  </step>

**File Structure:**

```yaml
# generated: {date}
# last_updated: {date}
# Methodology record: docs/development/SP-<sequence>.md
#   (one line per sprint record, oldest first — add the new sprint's line and

# project: {project_name}
# project_key: {project_key}

# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - Developer typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
# - Retrospective appends its action items to action_items; sprint-status surfaces open ones

<action>Write the complete sprint status YAML to {status_file}</action>
<action>**Write the SP gate record** (Development Gate 2 — the quality/deploy gates
and the record inventory verify chain progress through this FILE, not through
sprint-status.yaml). From `{metodoloji-root}/templates/_template_SP.md`, write
`{project-root}/docs/development/SP-<sequence>.md` — the next zero-padded id in
`docs/development/SP-*.md` (`SP-001`, `SP-002`, …; the record header, the story
records' `Sprint: SP-NNN` line and the board run key all use this SAME id, so
never a date: a date-named record parses as its year and two sprints of that year
become indistinguishable; then add this sprint's `# Methodology record:
docs/development/SP-<sequence>.md` line to the YAML's pointer list and KEEP the
earlier lines — a single pointer stops naming sprint 1 the moment sprint 2 is
planned, and check-methodology.sh CHECK 6 fails when the board forgets a sprint)
— with the template's fields filled
from this run — Status is one of `planned | in-progress | completed | cancelled`,
Date is the sprint window (or this run's date when scope was just cut),
**Readiness input** is the IR record this sprint plans from (the id + path, e.g.
`IR-001 (docs/development/IR-001.md)` — this IS the SP → IR hop the story chain
check reads, and a sprint record that names no IR record fails with `SP record
SP-00N does not reference any … (IR) record`), Sprint
goal is one sentence, Stories lists the epic/story keys with priority and the
counts from this run, Blockers/Dependencies name anything currently known. Skip
sections that carry nothing yet (Daily Notes, Sprint Review, Retrospective
Findings stay as template placeholders — they fill at sprint end). Re-running
sprint planning to REFRESH statuses updates {status_file} and the board
heartbeat only — the record's Status field, not a new file, carries the sprint's
own state; overwrite the record only when sprint scope actually changed.</action>
<action>CRITICAL: Metadata appears TWICE - once as comments (#) for documentation, once as YAML key:value fields for parsing</action>
<action>Ensure all items are ordered: epic, its stories, its retrospective, next epic...</action>
<action>If the existing file had an action_items section, write it back unchanged after development_status</action>
</step>

<step n="5" goal="Validate and report">
<action>Perform validation checks:</action>

- [ ] Every epic in epic files appears in {status_file}
- [ ] Every story in epic files appears in {status_file}
- [ ] Every epic has a corresponding retrospective entry
- [ ] No development_status items in {status_file} that don't exist in epic files
- [ ] action_items section (if it existed) carried over unchanged
- [ ] All status values are legal (match state machine definitions)

**Next Steps:**

1. Review the generated {status_file}
2. Use this file to track development progress
3. Agents will update statuses as they work
4. Re-run this workflow to refresh auto-detected statuses

<action>Close the board run in one call — sprint heartbeat + next-stage signal + intent bridge: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py mirror --key SP-<sequence> --value "sprint status: {status_file} — <epic_count> epics, <story_count> stories" --to bmad-create-story --note "Sprint status generated — {status_file}; start with the first ready-for-dev story" --project-root {project-root}` (reuse the SP record's id as the run key so the heartbeat, the record filename and every story's `Sprint: SP-NNN` line name the same sprint — the engine mirrors `methodology.last_sp` from the run key automatically, so the injected context shows how far the E→IR→SP→S→QR→PR relay progressed; repeating the same mirror never duplicates the waiting signal). Then mirror completion onto the intent bridge (`write --key status --value complete --type state --project-root {project-root}` — stop skips story checks once progress is `complete`), and run the close-out check (`blackboard.py doctor --json --project-root {project-root}` — waiting hand-off signals are the designed post-close state, not a failure: name them from `signal_warnings`, chain verdict `SIGNAL`; on `NEEDS ATTENTION`, surface the health warnings and resolve or disclose them before exiting).</action>

<action>Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow.on_complete` — use your harness-native shell tool with the command as given (no extra wrapper params) — if the resolved value is non-empty, follow it as the final terminal instruction before exiting.</action>

## Additional Documentation

### Status State Machine

**Epic Status Flow:**

```
backlog → in-progress → done
```

- **backlog**: Epic not yet started
- **in-progress**: Epic actively being worked on (stories being created/implemented)
- **done**: All stories in epic completed

**Story Status Flow:**

```
backlog → ready-for-dev → in-progress → review → done
```

- **backlog**: Story only exists in epic file
- **ready-for-dev**: Story file created (e.g., `stories/1-3-plant-naming.md`)
- **in-progress**: Developer actively working
- **review**: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
- **done**: Completed

**Retrospective Status:**

```
optional ↔ done
```

- **optional**: Ready to be conducted but not required
- **done**: Finished

**Action Item Status:**

```
open → in-progress → done
```

- **open**: Committed during a retrospective, not yet addressed
- **in-progress**: Actively being worked on
- **done**: Completed

### Guidelines

1. **Epic Activation**: Mark epic as `in-progress` when starting work on its first story
2. **Sequential Default**: Stories are typically worked in order, but parallel work is supported
3. **Parallel Work Supported**: Multiple stories can be `in-progress` if team capacity allows
4. **Review Before Done**: Stories should pass through `review` before `done`
5. **Learning Transfer**: Developer typically creates next story after previous one is `done` to incorporate learnings
