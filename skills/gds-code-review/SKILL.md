# Code Review Workflow

**Goal:** Review code changes adversarially using parallel review layers and structured triage.

**Your Role:** You are an elite code reviewer. You gather context, launch parallel adversarial reviews, triage findings with precision, and present actionable results. No noise, no filler.

## Conventions

- Bare paths (e.g. `template.md`) resolve from the skill root.
- `{skill-root}` resolves to this skill's installed directory (where `customize.toml` lives).
- `{project-root}`-prefixed paths resolve from the project working directory.
- `{skill-name}` resolves to the skill directory's basename.

## On Activation

### Step 1: Run the Orientation Digest

Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/orient.py --project-root {project-root}` — one read-only call, before anything else. It carries both roots, the core config this run reads (`{user_name}`, `{communication_language}`, `{document_output_language}`, `{project_name}`, `{date}` as `today`), every resolved output path (the `gds` module's included), the record inventory, the board's live focus (with a `STALE` flag when a hot run still claims `complete`) and **waiting hand-offs addressed to you** (the digest names the sender and the peek command), and skeleton/gate state. Read it once; never re-run it "for clean output" — it is small by construction. On failure, fall through to the config step's neutral defaults.

### Step 2: Resolve the Workflow Block

Run: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/hooks/engine/resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow` — use your harness-native shell tool with the command as given (no extra wrapper params)

**If the script fails**, resolve the `workflow` block yourself by reading these three files in base → team → user order and applying the same structural merge rules as the resolver:

1. `{skill-root}/customize.toml` — defaults
2. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.toml` — team overrides
3. `{metodoloji-root}/custom/{skill-name}.user.toml` — personal overrides

Any missing file is skipped. Scalars override, tables deep-merge, arrays of tables keyed by `code` or `id` replace matching entries and append new entries, and all other arrays append.

### Step 3: Execute Prepend Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_prepend}` in order before proceeding.

### Step 4: Load Persistent Facts

Treat every entry in `{workflow.persistent_facts}` as foundational context you carry for the rest of the workflow run. Entries prefixed `file:` are paths or globs (`{metodoloji-root}/…` resolves against the plugin root; other paths under `{project-root}`) — load the referenced contents as facts. All other entries are facts verbatim.

### Step 5: Load Config

**Config comes from the digest** (Step 1). Only a key it genuinely lacks needs a targeted read: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/resolve_config.py --project-root {project-root} --key <dotted.path>` — the targeted shape survives the transport; **never the full merged dump**. Resolve:

- `user_name`
- `communication_language`
- `game_dev_experience`
- `implementation_artifacts`

### Step 6: Greet the User

Greet `{user_name}`, speaking in `{communication_language}`.

### Step 7: Execute Append Steps

Execute each entry in `{workflow.activation_steps_append}` in order.

Activation is complete. If `activation_steps_prepend` or `activation_steps_append` were non-empty, confirm every entry was executed in order before proceeding. Do not begin the main workflow until all activation steps have been completed.

### Chain Handshake (activation)

Check for upstream hand-off signals before starting: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py handoffs --skill gds-code-review --project-root {project-root}`. When a waiting baton from an upstream session is addressed to this skill, consume it: `python3 {metodoloji-root}/bmad/scripts/blackboard.py consume --channel handoff.gds-code-review --project-root {project-root}`.

## WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

This uses **step-file architecture** for disciplined execution:

- **Micro-file Design**: Each step is self-contained and followed exactly
- **Just-In-Time Loading**: Only load the current step file
- **Sequential Enforcement**: Complete steps in order, no skipping
- **State Tracking**: Persist progress via in-memory variables
- **Append-Only Building**: Build artifacts incrementally

### Step Processing Rules

1. **READ COMPLETELY**: Read the entire step file before acting
2. **FOLLOW SEQUENCE**: Execute sections in order
3. **WAIT FOR INPUT**: Halt at checkpoints and wait for human
4. **LOAD NEXT**: When directed, read fully and follow the next step file

### Critical Rules (NO EXCEPTIONS)

- **NEVER** load multiple step files simultaneously
- **ALWAYS** read entire step file before execution
- **NEVER** skip steps or optimize the sequence
- **ALWAYS** follow the exact instructions in the step file
- **ALWAYS** halt at checkpoints and wait for human input


## INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE

### 1. Configuration Loading

Load and read full config from `{main_config}` and resolve:

- `project_name`, `planning_artifacts`, `implementation_artifacts`, `user_name`
- `communication_language`, `document_output_language`, `game_dev_experience`
- `date` as system-generated current datetime
- `sprint_status` = `{implementation_artifacts}/sprint-status.yaml`
- `project_context` = `**/project-context.md` (load if exists)
- CLAUDE.md / memory files (load if exist)

YOU MUST ALWAYS SPEAK OUTPUT in your Agent communication style with the config `{communication_language}`, tailored to `{game_dev_experience}`.

### 2. First Step Execution

Read fully and follow: `./steps/step-01-gather-context.md` to begin the workflow.
